# LootBeams
Loot Beams, a mod made for Terraria using tModLoader.

A special thank-you to everyone who has supported this small mod that I threw together in a few minutes, I never would have imagined something like this becoming as popular as it is, and for that I am very grateful.

Gives items Borderlands-style loot beams, with the colors corresponding to their rarity. That's about as simple of a description as you can get.
Yes, I know the beams of light on items were popularized by Diablo, I just had Borderlands as my main source of inspiration for the effect.

The mod is fairly configurable, there's a minimum rarity and value of items required for loot beams to appear, a whitelist and blacklist system, and even a way to customize the beam colors for specific items.
!! NEW UPDATE !!: You can now change the style of the beam and glow via the config menu, currently there is only 1 extra beam style, no new glow styles... yet. In the future you'll be able to mix and match beam and glow styles as you please.

If you're using Calamity alongside this mod, I highly recommend also using the Calamity Rarities mod, which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853817477
