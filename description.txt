A special thank-you to everyone who has supported this small mod that I threw together in a few minutes, I never would have imagined something like this becoming as popular as it is, and for that I am very grateful.

Latest Update:
Extremely minor behavior change to beams, they now fade out when you grab the item, which should make it pretty satisfying to collect a mountain of items from the ground. There's also a small flash when the beam appears, this (like many other things) of course is configurable.

Gives items Borderlands-style loot beams, with the colors corresponding to their rarity. That's about as simple of a description as you can get.
Yes, I know the beams of light on items were popularized by Diablo, I just had Borderlands as my main source of inspiration for the effect.

The mod is fairly configurable, there's a minimum rarity and value of items required for loot beams to appear, a whitelist and blacklist system, and even a way to customize the beam colors for specific items.

If you're using Calamity alongside this mod, I highly recommend also using the Calamity Rarities mod, which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853817477
