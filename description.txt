A special thank-you to everyone who has supported this small mod that I threw together in a few minutes, I never would have imagined something like this becoming as popular as it is, and for that I am very grateful.

Latest Update:
As there has been only one different style for the loot beams (a rather ugly one imo) and they are a pain to code, styling has been completely removed. They might not ever return, but I'll keep the assets around in case I ever find a better approach to beam/glow styles. Sorry for the two people who liked the arrow style.

Gives items Borderlands-style loot beams, with the colors corresponding to their rarity. That's about as simple of a description as you can get.
Yes, I know the beams of light on items were popularized by Diablo, I just had Borderlands as my main source of inspiration for the effect.

The mod is fairly configurable, there's a minimum rarity and value of items required for loot beams to appear, a whitelist and blacklist system, and even a way to customize the beam colors for specific items.

If you're using Calamity alongside this mod, I highly recommend also using the Calamity Rarities mod, which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853817477
