A special thank-you to everyone who has supported this small mod that I threw together in a few minutes, I never would have imagined something like this becoming as popular as it is, and for that I am very grateful.

Gives items Borderlands-style loot beams, with the colors corresponding to their rarity. That's about as simple of a description as you can get.

The mod is fairly configurable, there's a minimum rarity and value of items required for loot beams to appear, a whitelist and blacklist system, a way to customize the beam colors for specific items, as well as the ability to toggle an alternate color mode for those looking for the complete Borderlands experience.

IMPORTANT: If you're using Calamity alongside this mod, I highly recommend also using the Calamity Rarities mod, which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2853817477
